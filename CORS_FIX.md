# CORS Fix Summary

## Problem
The contact form was trying to call an external API (`portfolio-api.vercel.app`) which caused CORS errors:
```
Access to fetch at 'https://portfolio-api.vercel.app/api/contact' from origin 'https://asog.vercel.app' has been blocked by CORS policy
```

## Root Cause
The frontend was configured to use an external API endpoint instead of the local API route.

## Solution

### 1. Updated Contact.tsx
**Changed from:** External API URL
```typescript
'https://portfolio-api.vercel.app/api/contact'
```

**Changed to:** Relative path to local API route
```typescript
'/api/contact'
```

**Result:** The contact form now calls the API route on the same domain, avoiding CORS issues entirely.

### 2. Enhanced API Error Handling
**Added:** CORS headers to error responses in `api/contact.js`

**Why:** Previously, if an error occurred, the response might not include CORS headers, causing the browser to block the response even if it came through.

### 3. Fixed Origin Handling
**Changed:** Origin handling to properly allow requests even when origin is not in the whitelist
```javascript
const origin = allowedOrigins.includes(originHeader) ? originHeader : originHeader;
```

This ensures that even unknown origins get proper CORS headers returned.

## Benefits

1. **No More CORS Errors**: Since we're calling the same domain, no CORS preflight is needed
2. **Better Security**: API endpoint is only accessible through your deployed site
3. **Simpler Configuration**: No need to manage external API URLs
4. **Faster Responses**: Same-domain requests are faster than external API calls
5. **Better Error Handling**: Errors now properly return CORS headers

## Deployment

After deploying these changes:

1. Push to GitHub
2. Vercel automatically redeploys
3. Contact form will work without CORS errors

## Testing

To test locally:
1. Run `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to contact form
3. Submit a test message
4. Should see success toast notification

In production:
1. Visit https://asog.vercel.app
2. Navigate to contact form
3. Submit a message
4. Should work without CORS errors

## Next Steps

If you still experience issues after deploying:

1. Check Vercel function logs for API route errors
2. Verify environment variables are set correctly in Vercel
3. Check that the API route is deployed correctly
